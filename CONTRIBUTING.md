# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people  
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences  
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback  
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience  
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community  
* Actively promoting inclusivity by encouraging participation from marginalized groups  
* Using welcoming language to foster a positive environment for new contributors  
* Respecting boundaries by refraining from persistent communication after being asked to stop  
* Celebrating others' achievements and contributions openly  

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind  
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
* Public or private harassment  
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission  
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting  
* Engaging in microaggressions (subtle comments or behaviors that discriminate, often unintentionally)  
* Using offensive humor or sarcasm to belittle others  
* Disrupting conversations or events intentionally through interruptions, shouting, or inflammatory language  
* Spreading false or malicious rumors about community members  
* Exploiting authority or influence to gain personal advantage or coerce others  
* Dismissing or invalidating concerns related to Code of Conduct violations without proper investigation  

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at puskarroy600@gmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Conflict of Interest and Neutrality

Community leaders must disclose potential conflicts of interest when handling incidents. In such cases, another impartial leader will be assigned to ensure fair and objective enforcement. Leaders will maintain neutrality, avoiding public comments that may bias ongoing investigations.

## Inclusivity in Communication

All members must aim to:

* Use inclusive language that respects the diverse identities in the community  
* Avoid assumptions about gender, cultural backgrounds, or personal circumstances  
* Be mindful of communication styles—both synchronous (meetings, chats) and asynchronous (emails, forums)—to accommodate diverse availability and time zones  

## Healthy Collaboration and Feedback

We encourage members to:

* Resolve conflicts respectfully, seeking common ground rather than escalation  
* Collaborate openly, ensuring all contributors receive credit for their efforts  
* Avoid gatekeeping by making knowledge and resources accessible to everyone  

## Zero Tolerance for Retaliation

No member shall face retaliation for reporting incidents or participating in an investigation. Any form of retaliation will result in serious consequences, including temporary or permanent bans.

## Amendments and Revisions

This Code of Conduct is a living document, evolving with the community. We welcome feedback and suggestions to improve it. Community leaders will review the Code of Conduct regularly to ensure relevance and effectiveness. Any changes will be communicated transparently to all members.
